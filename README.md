## Scripts
Created a imgur account where [screenshots](https://sebastianholterhuset.imgur.com/all/) are provided as proof of work. It also illustrate what the different calculator does and how it looks. 

## Code Example
Using floats, variables and strings we are able to simplyfy the code for our calculators
```
var = float (bensin) + float (liter)
prisen =  float (var) * float (prispr) - float (bensin)
km = float (distanse) - float (prispr)
```
## Use on Linux machine 
To run the program on a linux machine, use the following command: ```python script_name.py ``` inside terminal/CLI.
If you are not able to run the script you need to make the python script executable in terminal/CLI on your machine do that by typing ```chmod +x script_name.py ```

## Use on Windows machine
Comming soon.
