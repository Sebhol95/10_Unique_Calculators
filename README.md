## Calculators
So you are in need of a calculator? This repository is a pit where all kind of calculators are dumped (Created by sebhol95) using Python. Check them out, they all work :open_mouth:. The idea is to continue creating calculators untill the repository reach 50 uniqe ones. 

## Motivation
The reason for this repository is the practice of my python game, by doing so i will also maintain my skills providing daily updates/ new calculators.

## Calculators
- [X] Simple additon Calculator
- [X] Simple subtraction Calculator
- [X] Simple multiplication Calculator
- [X] Simple division Calculator
- [X] Subnett Calculator
- [X] Multi Calculator
- [X] Hexadecimal Calculator
- [X] Decimal to binary Calculator
- [X] Octal Calculator
- [X] Exponent Calculator

Check out the [50 uniqe calculator count](https://github.com/Sebhol95/50-Uniqe-Calculators/projects/1) to see what kind of calculators that are comming. 

## Scripts
Created a imgur account where [screenshots](https://sebastianholterhuset.imgur.com/all/) are provided as proof of work. It also illustrate what the different calculator does and how it looks. 

## Code Example
Check out the break down of all the calculators at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sebhol95/50-Unique-Calculators/wiki/Calculators-function), it also show the functions of all the calculators!

Example of code: 
```
x = 1
print ("\n")
print ("The Simple addition Calculator")
print ("")
x = int(input("Press 1 to calculate or 0 to exit "))
while (x > 0):
    hex = input ("Enter any number in Hexadecimal form: ")
    if hex == 'x':
        exit()
    else:
        dec = int(hex, 16);
        print (hex, "in Decimal = ", str(dec));
```

## Use on Linux machine 
To run the program on a linux machine, use the following command: ```python script_name.py ``` inside terminal/CLI.
If you are not able to run the script you need to make the python script executable in terminal/CLI on your machine do that by typing ```chmod +x script_name.py ```

## Use on Windows machine
Comming soon.
